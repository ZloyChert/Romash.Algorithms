# 1. Algorithms
Here I will try to implement most of clasic and interesting algorithms.
I will try to implement all algorithms in both OOP approach and Structure-per-file (for students and other guys, that want to copy-paste it fastly)
## 1.1 [Search trees](https://github.com/ZloyChert/Romash.Algorithms/tree/master/SearchTrees/Trees)
### 1.1.1 Binary search trees
### 1.1.2 AVL trees

# 2. Benchmarking
## 2.1 [AVL trees](https://github.com/ZloyChert/Romash.Algorithms/blob/master/Benchmarking/AvlTreeBenchmarking.cs)
